    <q>Choose only one master - Nature.  Rembrandt</q>
<h2>Africa, South America, Europe </h2>
<h3>Printed on Paper or Canvas</h3>
    <p>Photography and travel has been a life long passion. 
        All my pictures are taken on a Pentax K1000 using 35mm film.  
        I used to have my own darkroom where I could develop my film and prints but now have scanned all my negatives and positives so that it can be printed digitally on different mediums and in different sizes.

        <p> I hope that if there is an image that stirs your heart that we can talk about possibilities of how one of my prints can adorn your living space.</p>
