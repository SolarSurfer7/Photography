<p>Photography and travel has been a life long passion. 

    All my pictures are taken on a Pentax K1000 using 35mm film.  
    I used to have my own darkroom where I could develop my film and prints but now have scanned all my negatives and positives so that it can be printed digitally on different mediums and in different sizes.

    <p> I hope that if there is an image that stirs your heart that we can talk about possibilities of how one of my prints can adorn your living space.</p>
